							<h4>Adam A.</h4>
							<p>Outstanding is an understatement.</p>
							<p>I called John when I was having trouble with my computer that was beyond my understanding... John helped me with troubleshooting, hardware upgrades and software reconstruction.</p>
							<p>John was patient, friendly, and understanding. He has an impressive knowledge of the latest programs on the market for diagnosis, repair, malware removal, and the overall market of computers. He was able to solve multi-layered problems and give feedback in simple terms as well as go into specifics on specs and explain pros and cons. He is happy to help educate you or just fix things which at different times I asked him to work in these different approaches based upon my level of enthusiasm and energy. When we moved into upgrading some hardware (my graphics card was in its last days by the time I called) his advice was helpful in both achieving better performance as well as identifying my needs and where I could be more sensible and save money.</p>
							<p>I am very selective who I actual give my personal recommendation to and John has earned it without reservation. Honest, easy to work with, capable and just plain awesome.</p>

							<h4>Brittany K.</h4>
							<p>He was amazing. He came and deleted a large amount of viruses from my husband's computer. Cleaned up all the issues and made sure we were protected for the future. He told us what he was doing step by step as well. He was able to get it all cleaned up and ready to go. Not to mention he was super nice and we had a great conversation while he worked. He worked as quick as the laptop would let him! Would 100% recommend using him!</p>
